## Websitegenerator
## ================
##
## `websitegenerator` is a basic static html/css generator.
##
## Use cases:
## ----------
##
## * Create templates for repetitive HTML and call them simply with code and parameters
## * On-the-fly HTML/CSS generation for HTTP servers (Note: generating and stringifying is pretty expensive and unoptimised)
##
## Writing HTML and CSS is very close to actually writing it, so no steep learning curve is required
## for learning this library.
##
## Examples:
## ---------

import websitegenerator/[generators, commons, sugar, mimetypes]
export generators, commons, sugar, mimetypes
